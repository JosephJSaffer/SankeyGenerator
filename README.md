# SankeyGenerator #

This Repository contains code to generate industrial energy use Sankey diagrams for any country.
The Jupyter Notebook SankeyGenerator.ipynb runs functions defined in the SankeyGenerator.py which produce different Sankey diagrams based on user input.
The Jupyter Notebook WebApp.ipynb can be used with Voila to create a functional web app to produce the Sankey diagrams. 
Due to storage issues, using the Balance.csv file in this repository, Sankey diagrams can only be produced for the year 2019, however 
if Sankeys for different years are desired then the "World energy balances" csv files found at 
https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/energy/data/iea-world-energy-statistics-and-balances_enestats-data-en can be saved locally as Balance.csv along with the other files
in this repository and Sankeys for any year for which the IEA has data can be produced.
